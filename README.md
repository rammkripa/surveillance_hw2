# Surveillance Aesthetics HW 2: Ram M Kripa

## Concept

Location data on its own is intrusive, but when combined with other forms of data, it can be very harmful to individuals. This artwork aims to show this effect through the fictional story of a person named "Lena," a high-schooler in Indiana. The viewer experiences Lenaâ€™s journey as she navigates her health and personal choices while being tracked by her Fitbit device. Through a series of maps, the artwork visualizes her movements, alongside menstrual cycle data, to illustrate how a single app can inadvertently expose intimate aspects of her life. As viewers progress through the maps, they will witness Lena's experiences, including her missed periods and eventual journey across state lines to seek an abortion. Each step is accompanied by context that highlights the privacy concerns surrounding health data and location tracking, ultimately raising awareness about the implications of such surveillance.

The artwork leverages web technology, utilizing Python for generating static maps and HTML for presentation. This medium allows for a direct and impactful visualization of Lena's story, emphasizing the interconnectedness of data points that shape her narrative. If I had months to develop this project further, I would expand on the interactive elements, potentially incorporating animations that reflect the emotional weight of Lena's journey. I would also use a fitbit-esque dashboard alongside the map to better emphazise how location data, health metrics, and demographic information intertwine, deepening the viewer's understanding of the vulnerabilities individuals face in our data-driven world.
